# Practice Reading Kernels

[09-testToFix-rowSumReduction](../09-testToFix-rowSumReduction) went quite well, but I want practice evaluating kernels on pen and paper first before I even touch the compiler. There were things i struggled with before like reasoning about coalescence and memory segment load efficiency. I'll try to master these, and once I've understood enough, improve as I can.
