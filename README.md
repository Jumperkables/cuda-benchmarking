# CUDA and Triton Learning and Benchmarking

This repo details my learning and benchmarking of CUDA and Triton together.

## Philosophy:
- CUDA exposes raw GPU scheduling, forcing proper comprehension with the architecture of GPUs, and efficiency thought patterns.
- Triton is the more efficient python library, with abstractions for convenience.
- Learning attitude:
  - I will learn the CUDA fundamentals first ...
  - ... and implement in Triton second
  - Demonstrating competence in both
  - This will also be a convenient way to show off benchmarking skills and compare
