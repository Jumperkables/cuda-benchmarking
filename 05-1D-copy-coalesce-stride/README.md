# 1D Copy
Copying elements from a single 1D array to another. This will prepare me for 2D copying, and other memory efficiencies

- I compiled the kernel and it ran well, but apart from taeching me the obvious concept of striding, theres not really much to benchmark in strided memcpy? I'm just doing less work each time. So time to hit a more substantial task
